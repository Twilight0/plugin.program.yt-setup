# Youtube Setup addon for Kodi

### About

Youtube Setup addon lets you easily apply your created keys inside Kodi and the Youtube addon.

### How to use it

First, get your own keys by reading [this wiki post](https://github.com/jdf76/plugin.video.youtube/wiki/Personal-API-Keys).

Then create a text file to load it locally or use a service like [pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/)

See file.txt **and** file.xml in examples directory, you can use either of the two formats, whichever looks more practical to you.

file.txt looks like this:

file.xml has the info in xml tags already, so pretty self explanatory:
